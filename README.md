## The Rundown
    
* Begin by reading from our transactions file
* Add each line to an ArrayList as a transaction
* Sort the objects in the ArrayList by date
* Prompt the user for various inputs
* Display their options, and navigate between menus
* Append any new transactions to both the file and ArrayList
* Allow the user to narrow down their searches with criteria
* Present all data and confirm inputs in a readable format
* Have the application continue to run until user chooses to exit
